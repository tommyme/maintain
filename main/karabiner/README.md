## debug 
write your json config file directly may result in some bug 

there is a way to check that: 


access the json file on your broswer, your json broswer extension will help you locate the format error
in most cases, you just typed an extra comma

## some weird feature

the karabiner will cache the file of a url, so my script will use time stamp to generate different urls to let changes in my config file to work.


i just can't find where the cache file locates.

## known issue
mac typora下面, 使用ctrl+i应该是home,但是却表现出ctrl+home的特征.

## todo
app specific
- xcode ctrl io <-> command left/right arrow
